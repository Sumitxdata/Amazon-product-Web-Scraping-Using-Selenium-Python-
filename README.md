# Amazon-product-Web-Scraping-Using-Selenium-Python

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to scrape product information from Amazon using Python and Selenium. The scraped data includes product descriptions, prices, image URLs, ratings, and the total number of ratings. This README provides an overview of the project, instructions for running the code, and details about the data collected.

## Prerequisites

Before running the code, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Python (3.7 or higher)
- Selenium
- Chrome WebDriver
- pandas
- numpy


## Web Scraping, Simplified
Our powerful tool leverages the Python Selenium library to effortlessly extract essential product information from Amazon, including:

* Product Descriptions
* Prices
* Image URLs
* Ratings
* Total Ratings


You can install these dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install selenium pandas numpy
```

## Usage

The main script, `amazon_product_scraper.ipynb`, demonstrates how to use Selenium to scrape product information from Amazon. The code is organized into sections for retrieving product details, such as descriptions, prices, images, ratings, and total ratings. The scraped data is then saved to a CSV file for further analysis.

You can customize the script to scrape specific product categories or search results by modifying the Amazon search URL within the code.


## Output

The scraped data is stored in a CSV file named `Amazon Product Scraping.csv`. This file contains columns for product descriptions, prices, image URLs, ratings, and total ratings.
